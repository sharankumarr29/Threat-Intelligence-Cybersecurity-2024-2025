# Threat-Intelligence-Cybersecurity-2024-2025
Research-based threat intelligence project covering modern cyber threats, attack techniques, real incidents, and defensive controls.
🔐 Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence Report (2024–2025)
📌 Overview

This repository contains a Threat Intelligence Report created as part of a Cyber Security & Ethical Hacking Internship.
The project analyzes the modern cybersecurity threat landscape (2024–2025), focusing on emerging attack techniques, their real-world impact, and practical defense strategies.

The goal of this project is to build awareness, analytical thinking, and professional reporting skills commonly expected from entry-level cybersecurity analysts.

🎯 Objectives

Understand and research modern cyber threats

Analyze impact on individuals and organizations

Study real-world cyber incidents

Propose effective preventive and mitigation measures

Present findings in a professional threat intelligence report format
