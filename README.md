# Threat-Intelligence-Cybersecurity-2024-2025
Research-based threat intelligence project covering modern cyber threats, attack techniques, real incidents, and defensive controls.

## Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence Report (2024–2025)

## Overview

This repository contains a Threat Intelligence Report created as part of a Cyber Security & Ethical Hacking Internship.
The project analyzes the modern cybersecurity threat landscape (2024–2025), focusing on emerging attack techniques, their real-world impact, and practical defense strategies.

The goal of this project is to build awareness, analytical thinking, and professional reporting skills commonly expected from entry-level cybersecurity analysts.

## Objectives

- Understand and research modern cyber threats

- Analyze impact on individuals and organizations

- Study real-world cyber incidents

- Propose effective preventive and mitigation measures

- Present findings in a professional threat intelligence report format

## Threats Covered

The report covers five major modern cybersecurity threats:

- AI-Powered Phishing Attacks

- AI-generated emails, deepfake voice/video scams, social engineering

- Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)

- Commercial ransomware kits, double extortion models

- Cloud Security Misconfigurations

- Publicly exposed cloud storage, weak IAM policies

- IoT Vulnerabilities

- Insecure smart devices, botnets, weak firmware security

- Zero-Day Exploits

- Unknown vulnerabilities exploited before patches are released

## Impact Analysis

Each threat is analyzed based on its impact on:

### Individuals

- Identity theft

- Financial fraud

- Privacy invasion

- Data loss

### Organizations

- Data breaches

- Operational downtime

- Financial losses

- Legal and compliance risks

- Reputational damage

## Real-World Case Studies

The report includes real cyber incidents related to each threat category, helping bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical attacks, such as:

- AI-driven deepfake fraud cases

- Ransomware attacks on organizations

- Cloud data breaches due to misconfigurations

- IoT botnet campaigns

- Zero-day exploitation in enterprise systems

## Preventive & Defensive Measures

Key security controls discussed in the report include:

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Zero Trust Security Model

- Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)

- Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)

- Regular patch management

- Security awareness training

- Backup and incident response planning

## Skills Demonstrated
